####This is an academic project by my teammate and me. This project is a real-time ordering Android App.
-User should be able to login as customer or chef
-Customer should be able to select food and checkout
-Chef should be able to check orders, inventory and modify status of orders.
-Customer should be able to receive messages from chef and transfer it back(If the customer want to continue the order when the inventory is not available).
-There are more trivial features.I will update it later.
